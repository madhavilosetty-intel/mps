# Build and Deploy Microservices with Local Docker* Images

## Overview

This section outlines the setup of the Active Edge's microservices and client application. Take this path to install MPS and RPS as Docker images that will function as services on a local system or the cloud as in Figure 1.

## What You'll Need

**Hardware**

At minimum, to install and use Active Edge, a network configuration must include:

-  A development system 
-  At least one IntelÂ® vPro device
-  A flash drive or equivalent means to transfer files between

Both systems must use a wired (i.e., cable) connection on the same network.

**Software**

The **development system** hosts Management Presence Server (MPS) and Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) and requires the following software:

- [Docker* Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows* or Linux*

    Docker Configuration Details:

    - The Docker for Windows installer defaults to enable all the requiredsettings for this tutorial.
    - After successful installation, the Docker icon (whale), will appear on thetask bar.
    - To troubleshoot the installation, [see the troubleshooting guide](https:/docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/).

- [Chrome* Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

If using a Windows-based Development System, also requires:
    
- [Microsoft Visual Studio*](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): 2019 or newer version of Visual Studio Community/Professional

      

## What You'll Do

Follow the steps in these sections sequentially to deploy Docker* images on a local development system: 

- Build and Deploy Docker* Images Locally
- Configure RPS
- Build RPC on Managed Device
- Manage Device

Run instructions in these sections can use Microsoft Windows* or Linux* environments. The terminal may be A) the Windows Command Prompt in Administrator mode or B) the Linux* shell/terminal. 

Estimated completion time: **15 minutes**
