# Build and Deploy Docker* Images for MPS and RPS Locally

Management Presence Server (MPS) and Remote Provisioning Server (RPS)  provide support for deploying the services as Docker* images, standardized packages containing an application's source code, libraries, environment, and dependencies. 

A Docker container is the instantiation of a Docker image as a virtualized unit that separates the application from the environment. Docker* containers start and run reliably, securely, and portably inside different environments, eliminating some of the usual problems that occur with software deployment on varying platforms.

## What You'll Do

This section describes how to deploy MPS and RPS as Docker* images on the development system:

1. Clone the repositories.
2. Build the images.
3. Set the environment variables.
4. Run the tool [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool on a sample configuration file to define and enable a multi-container environment. 


## Clone the MPS and RPS Repositories

Navigate to a directory of your choice for development.

### Clone MPS

1\. Clone the MPS repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/mps.git
```

2\. Checkout the ActivEdge branch.

```
cd mps
git checkout ActivEdge
```

### Clone RPS

1\.Clone the RPS repository to the same parent directory as MPS.

```
git clone https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/rps.git
```

After the `git clone` commands complete, the parent directory will contain an MPS and RPS folder.

```
ðŸ“¦parent
 â”£ ðŸ“‚mps
 â”— ðŸ“‚rps
```

2\. Checkout the ActivEdge branch.

```
cd rps
git checkout ActivEdge
```

## Build the Docker Images
Build the MPS and RPS Docker images from their respective directories with the **build -t** command, giving the image a name and tag:

[docker build . -t [name:tag]](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)  

- Create a name and tag with lowercase letters, digits, and separators (i.e., underscores, periods, and dashes).
- Do not end a name or tag with a separator.
- Tags contain up to 128 characters.

> **Note: Building a fresh Docker image may take several minutes.** 

### Build MPS

1\. Navigate to MPS folder and build the Docker image. 

```
cd ../mps
docker build . -t mps:v1
```

> **Note:** On completion, a security warning is normal during local setup with the default values for developer testing environments.

### Build RPS

2\. Navigate to the RPS folder and build the Docker image.

```
cd ..
cd rps
docker build . -t rps:v1
```

### Set the Environment Variables  
3\. After building the new MPS and RPS images, navigate to the mps\scripts\docker-compose folder and copy the .env.template file to .env. 

```
cd ..
cd mps/scripts/docker-compose
```

Windows Command:
```
copy .env.template .env
```

Linux Command:
```
cp .env.template .env
```

> **Note: Preserve the .env.template file.**
>
> This file is very important to maintain. Always copy to a new file. 

4\. Open the .env file in a text editor. Set the image-related environment variables within the .env file.

Change the following fields:

| Field      |  Change to    |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| **RPS_IMAGE** | rps:v1 | 
| **MPS_IMAGE** | mps:v1 | 
| **MPS_COMMON_NAME** | Your development system's IP address |

> **Note: Forgot the name and tag from the build?**
>
> The **docker images** command lists repository names, tags, image IDs, and sizes. 
>
> ```
> docker images
> ```
>

<!-- 5. Set the proper proxy values if behind a proxy.

   HTTP_PROXY=http://[your-proxy-server]:[your-proxy-server-port]
   HTTPS_PROXY=http://[your-proxy-server]:[your-proxy-server-port]

   ```
   HTTP_PROXY=http://10.16.01.01:3030
   HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.16.01.01:3030
   ```

   > **NOTE: Behind a Corporate Proxy?**
   >
   > To download images and install npm packages inside a container on start, modify settings in ~/docker/config.json to reflect the correct proxy address. 
   >
   > For more information about how to modify the proxy settings, see [Configure Docker Client](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/#configure-the-docker-client).

## Run docker-compose

The environment file .env now contains the MPS and RPS environment variables to pass to the Docker engine. 

1\. Navigate to the the `mps/scripts/docker-compose` directory. 

2\. Run the `docker-compose up` command, which starts the containers. approximately 2-3 minutes to start the containers.

```
docker-compose up
```

3\. **Important**: While the `docker-compose up` command is running, you may see a pop-up ask for permission for Docker Desktop Filesharing. You must select **Share It** for the `docker-compose up` command to execute successfully.  If the pop-up expires,`docker-compose up` will fail.  You must run `docker-compose down` and then rerun `docker-compose up` to successfully start the containers.

<!-- ## Check Logs
Alternatively, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in the background.  To view the logs in a separate window, follow the steps below.

Check the logs to ensure the MPS and RPS services are properly handling the traffic from end devices. 

1. Allow the previous command line window for mps and rps to continue to run. Open a new command line window to run the **docker-compose logs** command. 
2. Navigate to the docker-compose folder

3. Type the **docker-compose logs** command.

   docker-compose logs [name of service]

   ```
   docker-compose logs mps
   ```
