Intel AMT&reg; devices are capable of being activated into two modes:

- Client Control Mode: This mode limits some of Intel AMT functionality, reflecting the lower level of trust.

    Features requiring User Consent:
    
      - Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) Control
      - IDE-Redirection for sharing and mounting images remotely

- Admin Control Mode: In this mode, there are no limitations to Intel AMT functionality. This reflects the higher level of trust associated with these setup methods.

### What You'll Need

- Provisioning Certificate

    By purchasing a certificate, you'll be able to remotely activate an Intel AMT device in Admin Control Mode (ACM). This feature enables you to disable User Consent. Provisioning Certificates are available from four different Certificate Authorities:

    - [Comodo](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology/how-to-install-comodo-certificates.html)
    - [DigiCert](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000055009/technologies.html)
    - [Entrust](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000055010/technologies/intel-active-management-technology-intel-amt.html)
    - [GoDaddy](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/software/software-applications/how_to_purchase_and_install_godaddy_certificates_for_setup_and_configuration.pdf)

- Set the Domain Suffix

    Ways to set the domain suffix of the AMT device:

    - Manually on the AMT device through MEBX, find instructions on how to do it [here](../Topics/mebx.md)
    - Set DHCP Option 15 to DNS Suffix within the Router settings

>**Important Note:** This tutorial assumes both the MPS and RPS servers were successfully set up and running. If not, please refer to [Get Started with Local Microservices](../Local/overview.md) to begin.

### Create a Profile

Profiles provide configuration information to the AMT Firmware during the activation process with the Remote Provisioning Client (RPC).

!!! note "Production Environment"
        In a production environment, devices are typically activated in ACM mode.  ACM mode enables KVM access to devices without user consent. In most IoT use cases, edge devices such as digital signage or kiosks may not have immediate access to it or employees nearby.  ACM mode proves immensely helpful in these scenarios.

<br>

1\. Select the Profiles tab from the menu on the left.

2\. Under the Profiles tab, click New in the top-right corner to create a profile.

3\. Specify a Profile Name of your choice.

4\. Uncheck Generate Random Password.

!!! note "Production Environment"
        In a production environment, you typically generate a random password for each AMT device to create a stronger, more secure AMT environment.

5\. Provide a strong AMT Password. 
    
>**Note:** This password must meet standard, 'strong' password requirements:    
>> - 8 to 32 characters
>> - One uppercase, one lowercase, one numerical digit, one special character

6\. Select the name of the CIRA Config you created previously from the drop-down menu.

7\. Under Activation, select 'Admin Control Mode' from the dropdown menu.

>**Note:** If you'd prefer to activate the device into Admin Control Mode (ACM), click [here](../Tutorials/acmActivation.md).

8\. Click Create.

### Create a Domain

In addition to creating a CIRA Config and a Profile. A Domain **must** be created to activate a device into Admin Control Mode.

Intel AMT checks the network domain suffix against the provisioning certificate as a security check. During provisioning, the trusted certificate chain is injected into the AMT firmware.  AMT verifies that the certificate chain is complete and is signed by a trusted certificate authority.

<br>

1\. Select the Domains tab from the left-hand menu.

2\. In the top-right corner, click New.

[![RPS New Domain](../assets/images/RPS_NewDomain.png)](../assets/images/RPS_NewDomain.png)

<br>

3\. Specify a Domain Name of your choice.

4\. Provide your Domain Suffix. This is the actual DNS Suffix of the network domain that is set in DHCP Option 15 or manually on the AMT device through MEBX.

5\. Click Browse and select your purchased Provisioning Certificate.  This certificate must contain the private key.

6\. Provide the Password of the Provisioning Certificate used to encrypt the .pfx file.

7\. Click Create.

Example Domain:

After successfully creating the domain, continue with the activation process by building and running the Remote Provisioning Client (RPC).
